# NdT3 Discord Bot

This is my first Discord bot made using [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js).

# It currently has these features:
  - Kicking users
  - Banning users
  - Ping command
  - Eval command
  - Purge
  - Say command (says what you tell it to say)
  - Stats
  - Stopping the bot using a command
  - Playing music (new feature, not yet tested/finished)
  - Testing command (Testing, testing, 1 2 3)
  - Change settings command

# Planned features!

  - Music commands
  - Embeds
  - Deleted message logs

### Installation

This bot requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8+ to run. It also requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **2.7.x** (no, Python 3.x.x does not work) for the node-opus dependency (for music commands). 

Once you have those installed, install the dependencies and start the bot

```sh
$ cd DiscordBot
$ npm install
$ node start
```
